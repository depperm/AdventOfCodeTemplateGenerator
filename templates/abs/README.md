# ABS Language
[Documentation](https://www.abs-lang.org/docs/)

###  Install

#### Windows
After putting exe in PATH I had to also rename the exe to abs. Multi-line output in the terminal doesn't seem to work (https://github.com/abs-lang/abs/issues/514)

## How to run
`abs advent.abs <part> <optional file>`

### Part:
 - one
 - two

### Optional File:
If you want to specify a different file, say for the demo, include it after the part.
`abs advent.abs one demo.txt`
